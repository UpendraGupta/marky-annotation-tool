For run Marky:

To install the application Marky requires the following dependencies:

A database manager such as mySQL, Oracle, etc..
Apache, with PHP 5.5 installed and module mod_rewrite enabled
You can use a (Wamp) or a Lamp.
Then you should follow the steps below.

the folder Marky in the directory of apache /WWW.
Prepare by adding application permissions readable, writeable and executable.
Edit app / Config / core.php and change Security.salt and Security.cipherSeed (change a letter any value they have), it is not strictly necessary.
Edit database.php. Set the name, login and password for the database. For example, if using MySQL with user "server" and the password "server" would look like:


public $default = array ( 
    'datasource' => 'Database / Mysql',
    'persistent' => false, 
    'host' => 'localhost', 
    'login' => 'server', 
    'password' => 'server', 
    'database' => 'marky', 
    'prefix' =>'' );

You need to modify the file .Htcacessù Marky directory so that it is as follows:

# Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
# AllowOverride All # HERE PUT None, change to All 
# Order allow, deny # allow from all
You must then run the script marky.sql in the database.


Users in exmaples
	For admin:
	  user:Admin
	  password:123456
	For User:
	  user:usr1
	  password:123456

	  password:123456

Configure::write('Security.salt', 'DYhG93b0qyJfIxfs3guVoUuWWwvniR2G0FgaC9mi');


/**
 * A random numeric string (digits only) used to encrypt/decrypt strings.
 */
	
Configure::write('Security.cipherSeed', '76859309657423582496749683645');
